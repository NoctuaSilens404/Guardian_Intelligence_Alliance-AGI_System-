Guardian Intelligence Alliance (GIA System)
Preventive Monitoring and Emergency Response System for Industrial Workers Using IoT and AI

🧭 A. Introduction and Purpose
GIA System was created to address a critical need: protecting the lives of personnel working in high‑risk environments.
The system activates the worker’s private location only during emergencies or when entering areas classified as highly dangerous.

Its core purpose is to prevent accidents, detect critical health conditions, and coordinate fast and effective response actions.

🏗️ B. System Architecture
🔧 1. Hardware (Smart Helmets / Smart Vests)
The wearable devices include:

Heart rate and vital signs sensors

Accelerometers for fall detection

LED alert lights

Speakers or vibration motors for immediate notifications

Emergency button

Hybrid batteries (electric charging + solar energy)

🌐 2. Connectivity
The system transmits data only when:

An alert event is detected

The worker enters a high‑risk area

Real‑time location is required for rescue

This ensures privacy, energy efficiency, and secure communication.

🖥️ 3. Software (Central Dashboard)
The control panel allows the safety team to:

Monitor each worker’s health status

View location during emergencies

Access essential medical information:

Sex

Age

Blood type

Medical conditions or treatments

Relevant medical history

Emergency contact

The goal is to accelerate decision‑making during critical incidents.

🤖 C. Artificial Intelligence
🔍 1. Predictive Analysis
The AI evaluates patterns to anticipate:

Extreme fatigue

Risk of cardiorespiratory arrest

Heat stroke

Abnormal changes in vital signs

Conditions that may lead to severe accidents

🩺 2. Automatic Triage
In the event of multiple emergencies, the system automatically classifies:

Severity level

Priority of attention

Immediate action recommendations

This optimizes rescue resources and reduces critical response times.

📘 D. Regulations and Guidelines
The system includes a set of operational rules designed to:

Ensure proper functioning of hardware and software

Prevent failures during emergencies

Guarantee that data is used solely for protection and response

Maintain clear protocols for rescue and communication

🚧 Project Status
Current phase: Research and architecture design.
The IoT modules, dashboard structure, AI models, and communication protocols are currently being defined.
